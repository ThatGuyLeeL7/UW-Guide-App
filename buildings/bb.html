  <h3>About</h3>

  <p>The small Birmingham Block is just three classrooms and you almost don't realize it's there as you walk from GWP to
    WCG. But walking along Pacific, its importance becomes more apparent. It is home to the campus's first coffee shop
    (a Starbucks, of course), that opened with the campus in 1997.</p>
